- Content does not need to be persistent between sessions, but the user must be able to enter new messages in any of the chat rooms.
- The number of chat rooms must be preset and it is not mandatory that new ones can be added from the user interface.
- The interface must be developed so that it remains consistent with an unlimited number of messages.

### Requirements:
- Use React.js for user interface development.
- Minimum 3 Chat Rooms.
- The interface must be Full Responsive.

### Bonus Points:
- The possibility of creating new users, in this case use [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/api) to load their data.

### Tips:
- Use a CSS preprocessor (e.g. SASS) or a library for using CSS-in-JS technologies (e.g. styled-components). Choice.
- Folder with [Preview and Assets](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2m4c1yo3bacqx6u/AAAtMJ2qFNlxjwb9FZt_CeGUa?dl=0).

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
